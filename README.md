## Description

This web application is a social media application that allows users to connect and share their thoughts by making posts, commenting on other’s posts, and up/down voting other’s posts. The motivation behind this project was to connect people and in the future make the platform more tech centric to become a network for people to talk all things tech. We built this app with a separate front and back end, with the front-end hosted on Netlify and the back-end hosted on Heroku. We also used a MERN stack to build this application, with full CRUD functionality for both posts and comments. Users are also able to create accounts with authentication and sign-in/sign-out functionality.
